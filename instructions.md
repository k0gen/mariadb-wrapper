# Welcome to MariaDB

MariaDB is a database intended primarily for internal use by embassyOS services.

This obviously does not prevent you from using this database server for your own locally hosted applications that are dependent on MariaDB or MySQL.

The datebase `root` password is randomly generated during first startup and can be viewed in **MariaDB > Properties**.
